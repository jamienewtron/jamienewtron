Hi, I am Jamie! I am an Information Technlogy student who lives in the Philippines. I am just here trying my best to learn and relearn in this dynamic technological environment.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Project Management and UX Design in Coursera.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio using Three.js.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to watch movies, read books, and browse for outfits in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I took programming classes in highschool but I hated it.
